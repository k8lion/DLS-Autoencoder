This model utilizes 3 convolutional layers with non-unit stride to accomplish downsampling while increasing channels. The output of the final convolutional layer in the encode stage outputs a 16x16x16 vector, which is converted to the half datatype to fit with the 8192 byte requirement. The decode network mirrows the encode network by first converting back to the float datatype and then using transposed convultional layers to upsample the image dimensions while decreasing channels. The netwrok was trained on the MSCOCO dataset.
